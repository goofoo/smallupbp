1. Surface handling {mirror / glossy} now
	Ignore surface side issue, concentrate on participatin media

2. How beam do now
	mutate vertices of beams, pdf of beam should be vertified but may not too different.

3. Pixel reuse
	Just reuse participating media part

4. Parallel
	per radius parallel (as framework)
	generate photon beams
	join first initial result
	
	loop:
		per radius parallel (as framework)
		mutate each photon beams
		join result
